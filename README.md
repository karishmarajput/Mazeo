# Mazeo
<h3>Maze Solver and Generator</h3><br>
This website generates mazes with Randomized depth-first search, also known as the "recursive backtracker" algorithm and solves them with DFS. The maze and the solution are visualized on the HTML <canvas>.

 <br>
 <h3>Maze Generator</h3>
  The depth-first search algorithm of maze generation is frequently implemented using backtracking.

  <h3> Maze Solver-DFS</h3>
  The maze is solved usng DFS. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search">Depth-first search (DFS)</a> is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures.
