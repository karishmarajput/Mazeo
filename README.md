#Maze Solver and Generator<br>
This website generates mazes with Randomized depth-first search, also known as the "recursive backtracker" algorithm and solves them with DFS. The maze and the solution are visualized on the HTML <canvas>.

  #Maze Generator
  The depth-first search algorithm of maze generation is frequently implemented using backtracking.
